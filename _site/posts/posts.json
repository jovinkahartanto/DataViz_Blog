The data set consists of 13 variables and 6497 observations. For the purpose of this exercise, we have combined the red wine and white wine data into one data file. It is called wine_quality and is in csv file format.\r\n3.1 Importing Data\r\nFirst, let us import the data into R by using read_csv() of readr package.\r\nR code\r\nwine <- read_csv(“data/wine_quality.csv”)\r\nNotice that beside quality and type, the rest of the variables are numerical and continuous data type.\r\n4.0 Univariate EDA with Histogram\r\nIn the figure below, multiple histograms are plottted by using ggplot() and geom_histogram() of ggplot2 package. Then, ggarrange() of ggpubr package is used to patch these histogram into a single figure to reveal the distribution of the selected variables in the wine quality data sets.\r\nRcode\r\nfa <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= fixed acidity)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) va <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= volatile acidity)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) ca <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= citric acid)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) rs <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= residual sugar)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) ch <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= chlorides)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) fSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= free sulfur dioxide)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) tSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= total sulfur dioxide)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) density <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= density)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) pH <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= pH)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) sulphates <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= sulphates)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) alcohol <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= alcohol)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”)\r\nggarrange(fa, va, ca, rs, ch, fSO2, tSO2, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, ncol = 4, nrow = 3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Critique of Visualisation\r\nTo explore different perspective and design more truthful and enlightening data visualisation, we will first observe the original visualisation of the data (Figure 1). The critiques will be divided into two section, clarity and aesthetics.\r\nFigure 12.1 Clarity\r\nThe title of the graph does not match the visualisation. The title leads us to expect that the graph will be showing merchandise trade data for period 2019 to 2020, meanwhile the x-axis label for Japan only shows year of 2020 and the period for the rest of the graph starts from 2019 and ends in 2021.\r\nThe period of the data used is inconsistent. According to the graph, it seems like it covers merchandise trade data from 2019 to 2021 for Hong Kong, Mainland China, Taiwan, US, and Malaysia. However, we can observe that for Japan, it only covers merchandise trade data in 2020.\r\nThe title of X axis is confusing. The axis title clearly mentions “Month of Period”, but the x-axis label display years instead of months.\r\n2.2 Aesthetics\r\nThe graph will be easier to understand if line graph were used.\r\nAdding tick marks for both axis will be necessary since this graph is a continuous scale. The non existence of the graph make it harder to read the graph.\r\n3. Alternative Design\r\nThe alternative graphical design proposed can be seen below:\r\nThe proposed design above will improve the original visualisation in terms of:\r\n4. Step-by-Step Guide\r\nClean the raw data by selecting all countries’ merchandise trade data for the year 2019 to 2020. Copy the table from the raw dataset and paste it into the first row of the new created worksheet by using excel workbook. Clean import and export data are stored in two different worksheets. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
